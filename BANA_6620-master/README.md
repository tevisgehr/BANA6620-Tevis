# BANA_6620

This repository will hold all the materials for BANA 6620, which will provide a comprehensive introduction to fundamental computing and database techniques for your journey later in the program.  For each week, you will need to read through the lecture materials provided, as well as the additional linked materials.  The in class lecture will be provided as a means to supplement this material.  Additionally assignments will be posted here, and solutions to follow after the due date.  

I have not figured out the best way to grade assignments yet - this will likely be done via canvas.  In the past, canvas has worked quite well to serve this role.  Some assignments may be best to submit in person during class, so this is certainly something that will be considered as the class progresses.
