# Assignment 6

There will be nothing to turn in upon completing this assignment.  However, it will assure you have the basics of navigation within the terminal.  These are foundational commands, but there are many, many more commands.  This environment is incredibly useful, and it is foundational to becoming a software developer.

1. Open the terminal (or git for Windows users) and navigate to your home directory (`cd ~` will take us to our home directory).

2. Create a directory called `directory1`.

3. Navigate into `directory1`, and show (print) where you are to the command line.

4. Create a `file1.md` and a `file2.md`.

5. Show the contents of `directory1`.

6. How would you go about changing the name of `file1.md` to `file3.md`?  How would this be different than creating a second version, but keeping `file1.md`?

7. Within `directory1`, create `directory2`.  Again, show all the contents.

8. In one command, move all of the files from `directory1` into
`directory2`.  **Hint:** Think SQL here!

9. In one command, delete `directory2` and all its contents.

10. Individually remove all the contents in `directory1`.  Navigate up a directory, and delete `directory1`.  Why is it the case that we can use a different command do this than what we did in the previous question?
