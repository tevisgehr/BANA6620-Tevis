#### Introduction to Python

I will be doing my best to introduce what I consider the key aspects of Python.  The truth is that learning to code is not trivial - it takes a ton of time, practice, patience, and you mess up A LOT.  [This](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) is the main resource I would consider for learning to code, but I also learned a lot of what I know about coding in Python by using [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard).  This is an awesome way to practice coding.  The more you do it, the better you will get - that's all there is to it.
