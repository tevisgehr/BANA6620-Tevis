#### Homework 8

To practice these concepts, we will be using [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/latest/my-languages) and [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).  There are additional questions below for you to test your strength with these concepts. Get started with codewars, and feel free to stop me if you get a question you are stuck on.  We can work it out together.

1. Write a script that obtains the count of a user inputted letter in a user inputted string. Make sure to build this in such a way that it ignores the case of the inputted string and letter.

2. Write a script that creates a list of only the even numbers between 0 and a user inputted number.

3. Write a script that creates a list of only numbers divisible by a user inputted number that are between 0 and a user inputted number.

4. Write a function that takes in two lists and returns a sorted list of the common elements.

5. Write a script that takes a user inputted number and prints whether it is positive, negative or zero, with "The inputted number is (positive/negative/zero)".

6. Write a script that takes two user inputted numbers and prints "The first number is larger" or "The second number is larger" depending on which is larger.

7. Write a function that takes a number, and computes the sum from 0 to a the number.
