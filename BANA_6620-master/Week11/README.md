#### Week 11

We have done a lot to work on gaining a foundational understanding of programming, and we have worked together to put those ideas to use in Python.  This week, we will take some time to put these ideas to practice by looking at how we can apply Python to the 'Data Science' world.  One very nice resource includes the [following](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/statistical-analysis-python-tutorial/blob/master/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Pandas.ipynb).  Some of the most popular libraries for analyzing data in python include: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy stats, statsmodels, keras, scikit-image, as well as those mentioned [here](http://bigdata-madesimple.com/ten-handy-python-libraries-for-aspiring-data-scientists/).  It all depends on your task, but it is likely Python can handle whatever you can throw at it!
