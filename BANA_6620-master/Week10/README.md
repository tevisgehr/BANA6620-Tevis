#### Object Oriented Programming in Python

OOP is one of the most important, but also one of the most conceptually difficult topics we cover in this class.  This set of notes and homework are aimed to give you a fundamental understanding of writing classes and understanding OOP in Python.  Admittedly, I took a substantial amount of time to learn OOP.  If you truly want to be a strong background, you must learn this programming paradigm.  It takes patience and determination to iterate through the topic well enough to grasp fully and put it to use in a meaningful way.
